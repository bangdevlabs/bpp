# B++

### Rock Solid B++ —26 March 2026

Self-hosting compiler with modular compilation, type hints, dynamic arrays, two native backends (ARM64 + x86_64), and a monolithic fallback. The compiler compiles itself, caches per-module object files, and produces signed native binaries with zero external tools. Let's rock!

---

## Back to the Future

In 1972, Ken Thompson's B language evolved into C. The rest is history — C conquered systems programming, operating systems, and eventually everything.

But what if a small group of rebels at Bell Labs had taken B in a different direction? What if instead of chasing general-purpose computing, they'd focused on one thing: **making games**?

B++ is that alternate timeline.

A language with the soul of B — every value is a word, no type declarations, no header files — but with 64-bit words, named struct fields, and a compiler that produces native binaries directly. ARM64 macOS and x86_64 Linux. No assembler. No linker. No external tools.

And a standard library that is, itself, a game engine.

## The Language

```bpp
import "stbgame.bsm";

enum Dir { UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT }

auto px, py, facing;

main() {
    game_init(320, 180, "B++ Game", 60);
    px = 160; py = 90; facing = RIGHT;

    while (game_should_quit() == 0) {
        game_frame_begin();
        if (key_pressed(KEY_ESC)) { break; }

        if (key_down(KEY_UP))    { facing = UP; }
        if (key_down(KEY_DOWN))  { facing = DOWN; }
        if (key_down(KEY_LEFT))  { facing = LEFT; }
        if (key_down(KEY_RIGHT)) { facing = RIGHT; }

        if (facing == UP)    { py = py - 2; }
        if (facing == DOWN)  { py = py + 2; }
        if (facing == LEFT)  { px = px - 2; }
        if (facing == RIGHT) { px = px + 2; }

        clear(BLACK);
        draw_rect(px, py, 16, 16, GREEN);
        draw_text("arrows to move", 90, 4, 1, GRAY);
        draw_end();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run:

```
bpp game.bpp -o game && ./game
```

No SDL. No raylib. No dependencies. One file in, one native binary out.

## What B++ Has

- **64-bit words** — every value is a 64-bit integer or double
- **Structs** — `struct Vec2 { x, y }` with heap (`auto`) or stack (`var`) allocation
- **Enums** — `enum State { MENU, PLAY, PAUSE, OVER }` resolved at compile time
- **Float math** — `sqrt`, `floor`, `fabs` via system FFI, IEEE 754 doubles
- **FFI** — call any C library: `import "SDL2" { void InitWindow(...); }`
- **Self-hosting** — the compiler compiles itself
- **Native binaries** — ARM64 Mach-O + x86_64 ELF, built-in codesign, zero external tools
- **Compiler diagnostics** — error codes (E001-E201), warnings (W001-W005), file:line locations
- **Cross-compilation** — compile Linux binaries from macOS (`--linux64`)
- **Type hints** — `auto x: byte`, `fn(dt: float)` — opt-in sub-word types for performance tuning
- **Modular compilation** — Go-model per-module codegen with .bo cache files (default for native backends)
- **Monolithic fallback** — single-pass pipeline for C emitter, ASM output, and future backends (WASM)
- **Module dependency tracking** — content hashing, topological sort, stale propagation (`--show-deps`)

## What B++ Doesn't Have

No classes. No templates. No exceptions. No garbage collector. No package manager. No build system. No 200MB toolchain download.

You write code. You compile it. You run it.

## The Standard B Library (stb)

stb is the game engine. It's not a wrapper around SDL or raylib — it **is** the engine, written entirely in B++.

| Module | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `stbdraw` | Software framebuffer rendering — rects, circles, lines, sprites, text |
| `stbinput` | Keyboard and mouse input from memory arrays |
| `stbgame` | Game loop — init, frame timing, quit |
| `stbfont` | 8×8 bitmap font for text rendering |
| `stbmath` | Vec2, PRNG, abs, min, max, clamp |
| `stbarray` | Dynamic arrays with shadow header |
| `stbstr` | String operations and growable string builder |
| `stbbuf` | Raw buffer read/write (u8, u16, u32, u64) |
| `stbfile` | Load files from disk |
| `stbui` | Immediate-mode UI widgets |
| `stbcol` | Collision detection (AABB, circles) |
| `stbio` | Console I/O (print_int, print_msg) |

Every pixel is written to a memory buffer. The compiler's platform layer puts those pixels on screen. On macOS, that's Cocoa + CoreGraphics — no SDL, no OpenGL, no Metal. Just `objc_msgSend` and a `CGBitmapContext`.

## Four Backends, Same Code

The game code never changes. Only the import:

```bpp
// Native macOS — zero dependencies:
import "stbgame.bsm";

// Linux terminal — ANSI rendering, zero dependencies:
import "stbgame.bsm";
// compile with: bpp --linux64 game.bpp -o game

// SDL2:
import "stbgame.bsm";
import "drv_sdl.bsm";

// Raylib:
import "stbgame.bsm";
import "drv_raylib.bsm";
```

## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
# Build the compiler (it compiles itself)
bpp src/bpp.bpp -o bpp

# Install globally
sudo cp bpp /usr/local/bin/
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/bpp/stb
sudo cp stb/*.bsm /usr/local/lib/bpp/stb/
```

### Run Examples

```bash
# Snake — native (no dependencies)
bpp examples/snake_native.bpp -o snake && ./snake

# Snake — SDL2 (requires SDL2 installed)
bpp examples/snake_sdl.bpp -o snake && ./snake

# Snake — raylib (requires raylib installed)
bpp examples/snake_raylib.bpp -o snake && ./snake

# Interactive demo — SDL2
bpp examples/sdl_demo.bpp -o demo && ./demo

# Bouncing cubes — raylib direct FFI
bpp examples/raylib_demo.bpp -o cubes && ./cubes
```

### Write Your Own

```bpp
import "stbgame.bsm";

main() {
    game_init(320, 180, "My Game", 60);
    while (game_should_quit() == 0) {
        game_frame_begin();
        if (key_pressed(KEY_ESC)) { break; }
        clear(DARKGRAY);
        draw_circle(160, 90, 40, RED);
        draw_text("B++", 140, 82, 2, WHITE);
        draw_end();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

```
bpp mygame.bpp -o mygame && ./mygame
```

## Platform Status

| Target | Status |
|--------|--------|
| macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon) | **Working** — native Cocoa, SDL2, raylib |
| Linux x86_64 | **Working** — static ELF binaries, ANSI terminal rendering |
| Windows x86_64 | Planned — codegen + Win32 platform layer |
| WebAssembly | Future — codegen + Canvas API |

stb is 100% pure B++ (no platform code). Each target only needs a codegen backend + platform layer. The game code and stb library stay identical across all platforms.

## Requirements

**macOS ARM64:**
- **No dependencies** for native games
- **SDL2** (`brew install sdl2`) for SDL examples
- **raylib** (`brew install raylib`) for raylib examples

**Linux x86_64:**
- Cross-compile from macOS: `bpp --linux64 game.bpp -o game`
- Run natively or in Docker — 45KB static binary, zero dependencies

## The Compiler

The B++ compiler is written in B++ and compiles itself. It produces
native ARM64 Mach-O binaries with built-in SHA-256 codesigning.

```
bpp source.bpp -o binary       # native ARM64 macOS (default)
bpp --linux64 src.bpp -o bin   # cross-compile to x86_64 Linux ELF
bpp --c source.bpp              # emit C (for debugging)
bpp --asm source.bpp            # emit ARM64 assembly
```

17 modules, ~11,000 lines of B++. Self-hosting verified at every stage.

## Contributing

B++ is open source and we want your help. The language is young and there's a lot to build:

**Platform ports** — Each new platform needs a codegen backend (instruction encoder + binary writer) and a platform layer (window, present, input, timing). ARM64 macOS and x86_64 Linux are done. Windows/Win32 and WebAssembly are open.

**Game tools** — Sprite editors, tilemap editors, level designers, particle systems — all built in B++ using stb. The language was made for this.

**stb modules** — Audio (`stbaudio`), tilemaps (`stbtile`), networking (`stbnet`), physics, pathfinding. Each is a pure B++ module with no platform dependencies.

**Games** — The best way to find what's missing in the language. Build a game, hit a wall, fix the compiler. That's how every feature in B++ was born.

**Documentation** — Tutorials, examples, guides. Especially for people coming from C, Lua, or Python game dev.

### How to start

1. Fork the repo
2. Pick something from the list above
3. Build and test (`bpp src/bpp.bpp -o bpp` to rebuild the compiler)
4. Open a PR

No bureaucracy. No code of conduct longer than the compiler. Just build cool stuff.
